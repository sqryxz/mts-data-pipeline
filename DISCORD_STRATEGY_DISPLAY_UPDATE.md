# Discord Strategy Display Update

## 🎯 **Problem Identified and Solved**

**Issue**: Discord alerts were showing "Strategy: Aggregated_Signal" for all signals, making it unclear which specific strategies contributed to the trading signals.

**Solution**: Enhanced Discord alerts to show detailed strategy information for both aggregated and individual signals.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **Enhanced Discord Webhook** (`src/utils/discord_webhook.py`)

Modified the `_create_signal_embed` method to intelligently display strategy information:

1. **For Aggregated Signals**: Shows contributing strategies
2. **For Individual Strategy Signals**: Shows the specific strategy name

### **Before vs After**

#### **Before (Generic Display)**
```
Strategy: Aggregated_Signal | MTS Pipeline
```

#### **After (Detailed Display)**

**For Aggregated Signals:**
```
🎯 Aggregated Signal | Strategies: multibucketportfolio, vixcorrelation, meanreversion | MTS Pipeline
```

**For Individual Strategy Signals:**
```
Strategy: multibucketportfolio | MTS Pipeline
```

## 🧪 **Test Results**

### **Aggregated Signal Test**
- ✅ **Created**: Bitcoin SHORT signal with 100% confidence
- ✅ **Contributing Strategies**: multibucketportfolio, vixcorrelation, meanreversion
- ✅ **Discord Footer**: `🎯 Aggregated Signal | Strategies: multibucketportfolio, vixcorrelation, meanreversion | MTS Pipeline`

### **Individual Strategy Test**
- ✅ **Created**: Ethereum LONG signal from multibucketportfolio strategy
- ✅ **Discord Footer**: `Strategy: multibucketportfolio | MTS Pipeline`

## 📊 **What You'll See in Future Discord Alerts**

### **Aggregated Signals**
When multiple strategies contribute to a signal, you'll see:
- **🎯 Aggregated Signal** indicator
- **List of contributing strategies** (e.g., "multibucketportfolio, vixcorrelation, meanreversion")
- **Full signal details** (price, confidence, position size, risk metrics)

### **Individual Strategy Signals**
When a single strategy generates a signal, you'll see:
- **Specific strategy name** (e.g., "multibucketportfolio", "vixcorrelation")
- **Full signal details** (price, confidence, position size, risk metrics)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Code Changes**
```python
# Add strategy information based on signal type
if signal.strategy_name == "Aggregated_Signal" and signal.analysis_data:
    # For aggregated signals, show contributing strategies
    contributing_strategies = signal.analysis_data.get('strategies_combined', [])
    if contributing_strategies:
        strategy_text = ", ".join(contributing_strategies)
        embed["footer"] = {
            "text": f"🎯 Aggregated Signal | Strategies: {strategy_text} | MTS Pipeline"
        }
    else:
        embed["footer"] = {
            "text": f"🎯 Aggregated Signal | MTS Pipeline"
        }
else:
    # For individual strategy signals, show the strategy name
    embed["footer"] = {
        "text": f"Strategy: {signal.strategy_name} | MTS Pipeline"
    }
```

### **Data Structure**
The system uses the `analysis_data` field in aggregated signals to store:
- `strategies_combined`: List of contributing strategy names
- `strategy_weights`: Weight of each contributing strategy
- `aggregation_method`: How the signals were combined

## 🎯 **Benefits**

1. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into which strategies contributed to each signal
2. **Accountability**: Easy to track performance of individual strategies
3. **Debugging**: Better understanding of signal generation process
4. **Trust**: Users can see the reasoning behind aggregated signals
