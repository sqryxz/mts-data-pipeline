- **Discord Integration**: Shows webhook configuration for each strategy
- **Environment Configuration**: Displays enabled strategies and weights
- **Strategy Summary**: Provides descriptions of each strategy's approach

### 2. **Enhanced Multi-Tier Scheduler** (`src/services/enhanced_multi_tier_scheduler.py`)

Added `_log_strategy_information()` method that displays during scheduler startup:

- **Active Strategies**: List of all loaded strategies with weights
- **Strategy Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of each strategy's approach
- **Discord Status**: Shows which strategies have Discord webhooks configured

- **Comprehensive Overview**: Complete picture of the strategy ecosystem

## 📊 Sample Output

When the system starts up, you'll now see detailed strategy information like this:

```
🎯 Strategy Configuration Check
📊 Checking Strategy Registry...
✅ Strategy Registry: ['vixcorrelation', 'meanreversion', 'volatility', 'ripple', 'multibucketportfolio']
✅ Loaded Strategies: ['vixcorrelation', 'meanreversion', 'volatility', 'ripple', 'multibucketportfolio']
📊 Strategy Weights: {'vixcorrelation': 0.25, 'meanreversion': 0.2, 'volatility': 0.2, 'ripple': 0.15, 'multibucketportfolio': 0.2}

📊 Active Strategies:
    📢 Vixcorrelation: 25.0% weight - 📈 VIX Correlation (Market regime detection, volatility analysis)
    📢 Meanreversion: 20.0% weight - 🔄 Mean Reversion (Overextended moves, drawdown analysis)
    📢 Volatility: 20.0% weight - 📊 Volatility (Breakout detection, volatility regime analysis)
    📢 Ripple: 15.0% weight - 🌊 Ripple (Specialized XRP analysis, momentum detection)
    📢 Multibucketportfolio: 20.0% weight - 🎯 Multi-Bucket Portfolio (Cross-sectional momentum, residual analysis, mean-reversion)

🔧 Aggregation: weighted_average conflict resolution, 5.0% max position size

📢 Checking Discord Integration...
✅ Discord Webhooks: 5 strategies configured
   ✅ vixcorrelation: confidence≥0.5, 3 assets
